/*
 * Vencord, a Discord client mod
 * SilentGroupCall — start DM/group calls without ringing the other members.
 *
 * See DESIGN.md for the full rationale. In short: Discord's client fires a
 * separate `ring` request when you start a call. If we never fire it, nobody
 * gets the incoming-call notification — but the call is still joinable and you
 * stay connected. This plugin monkeypatches that `ring` at runtime.
